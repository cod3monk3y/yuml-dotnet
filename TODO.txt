RawGame -> IGameHost   -- is not represented

-- if a base class has a member, all subsclasses show that member as an association


-- difficult to tell what assembly the types come from, maybe add a note
-- expand AROUND a type.. find all types that are immediately referenced from a type, and all types that reference that type in 1 step
-- expand AROUND a type by N steps
-- include method details
-- include member variable details

-- handle bidirectional associations properly
-- interface inheritance
-- [A]<-[B] doesn't have to write [A],[B],[A]<-[B]. it's redundant. If the type is part of a relationship, then
   it doesn't need to be included on its own


xx interface members aren't shown as associations (because interfaces are incorporated
into the type definitions?)

-- color public/private/internal classes
-- explicit number of instances (composition with count 4)
-- only PROPERTIES are shown as dependencies, not member variables
